# Example environment variables for local testing and CI
# Do NOT commit real secrets to the repository. Use GitHub Actions secrets for production.

# Web3Forms access key (sensitive) - set as secret WEB3FORMS_KEY in GitHub and mapped to VITE_WEB3FORMS_KEY in Actions
VITE_WEB3FORMS_KEY=

# (Optional) NRS Plus ordering URL (non-sensitive) - can be set as a variable or secret if you prefer
VITE_NRS_URL=

# (Optional) Google Tag Manager container ID (non-sensitive)
VITE_GTM_ID=

# Notes:
# - For local development, copy this file to .env.local and fill values (this file is ignored by git).
# - GitHub Actions workflow reads secrets.WEB3FORMS_KEY and exposes it as VITE_WEB3FORMS_KEY at build time.
# - Never commit actual secret values into the repository.
