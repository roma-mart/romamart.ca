# Seasonal Recolor Support

## Summary
This issue explores the potential for implementing seasonal recolors across the Roma Mart website. By leveraging the outcomes of the color investigation issue, we can create a flexible system that allows for temporary, event-based color themes (e.g., Christmas, National Day, Eid). This feature would enhance user engagement and align the website with seasonal branding opportunities.

## Objectives
1. **Leverage the Color System**
   - Utilize the centralized color system established in the color investigation issue.
   - Ensure all components support dynamic color updates.

2. **Define Seasonal Themes**
   - Create a set of predefined color palettes for major events and holidays.
   - Ensure each palette adheres to WCAG 2.2 AA+ standards for accessibility.

3. **Implement Theme Switching**
   - Develop a mechanism to toggle between seasonal themes and the default theme.
   - Ensure the theme switcher is lightweight and does not impact performance.

4. **Document the Process**
   - Provide guidelines for adding new seasonal themes.
   - Include examples of how to test and validate seasonal themes.

## Proposed Tasks
1. **Color System Integration**
   - [ ] Validate that the centralized color system supports dynamic updates.
   - [ ] Test all components for compatibility with dynamic color changes.

2. **Theme Design**
   - [ ] Create color palettes for Christmas, National Day, Eid, and other major events.
   - [ ] Validate each palette for accessibility and brand consistency.

3. **Theme Switching Mechanism**
   - [ ] Develop a lightweight theme switcher.
   - [ ] Ensure the switcher supports both manual and automated toggling (e.g., based on date).

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document the process for adding and testing new themes.
   - [ ] Provide examples of seasonal themes and their usage.

## Validation
- [ ] Test the theme switcher in staging and production environments.
- [ ] Validate all seasonal themes for accessibility and responsiveness.
- [ ] Ensure the default theme is restored seamlessly after a seasonal theme ends.

## Next Steps
1. Assign team members to specific tasks.
2. Establish a timeline for implementing seasonal recolor support.
3. Monitor progress and ensure alignment with the outcomes of the color investigation issue.

By implementing seasonal recolor support, Roma Mart can enhance its branding and user engagement while maintaining accessibility and performance standards.
