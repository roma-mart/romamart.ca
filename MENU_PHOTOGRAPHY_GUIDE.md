## 🥐 PASTRIES & BAKED GOODS

### Setup

## 🎨 LIGHTING GUIDE

### Natural Light (BEST)
**Window Light Setup:**
- Place item 2-3 feet from window
- Light should come from **side** (45° angle)
- Avoid direct sunlight (too harsh)
- Best time: 10am-3pm
- Cloudy day = soft, even light (actually great!)

### What to Avoid:
- ❌ Overhead fluorescent lights (yellow cast, harsh shadows)
- ❌ Direct sunlight (too bright, overexposed)
- ❌ Evening/night (need too much artificial light)
- ❌ Flash (washes out colors, looks unnatural)

---

## ✏️ EDITING (2 minutes per photo)

### iPhone Photos App

1. **Open photo** → Tap "Edit"
2. **Auto Enhance** (try it first)
3. **Manual Adjustments:**
   - **Light:** +10 to +25 (brighten)
   - **Contrast:** +5 to +15 (make it pop)
   - **Saturation:** +5 to +10 (food should look vibrant)
   - **Warmth:** +5 (makes coffee look warmer)
   - **Sharpness:** +10 to +15 (details pop)
4. **Crop:** Remove distractions, center product
5. **Straighten:** Use level tool if needed
6. **Done** → Save

### Food Photography Editing Tips:
- **Warm is Better:** Slightly warm tones (+5 warmth) make food inviting
- **Bright is Key:** Food photos should be bright and airy
- **Don't Overdo Saturation:** +5 to +10 max (looks fake otherwise)
- **Sharpen Details:** Especially for pastries (texture is important)

7. **Overhead Lights** → Use window light instead
8. **Yellow Cast** → Adjust "Warmth" slider in editing
9. **Glare on Cups** → Angle light differently

## 💡 PRO TIPS

6. **Natural is Best:** Don't over-style, keep it simple
7. **Consistency:** Use same setup for all photos (looks professional)
8. **Shoot Horizontal:** Most menu photos look better landscape
