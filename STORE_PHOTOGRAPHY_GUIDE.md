2. **Bracket Your Shots:** Take same photo at -1, 0, +1 brightness
3. **Walk Around:** Don't shoot from one spot, move around
4. **Use Both Hands:** More stable than one-handed
5. **Lean Against Something:** Wall, car, pole for stability
6. **Review on Computer:** Photos look different on big screen
7. **Shoot More Than You Need:** 3-5x the final count
8. **Return if Conditions Suck:** Don't force it on a cloudy/rainy day
