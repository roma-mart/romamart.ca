- ✅ **Immediate break-even** ($20 domain paid back in days)
- ✅ **Full ownership & control** (no vendor lock-in)
- ✅ **Skills developed** (React, SEO, accessibility) worth $5K-10K for future projects
- ✅ **$6,000 - $18,000/year incremental revenue** (conservative estimate)

**5-Year Outlook:**
- Cumulative revenue impact: $90,000 - $180,000 (indirect/attributed)
- Cumulative ongoing cost savings: $7,550 - $22,400 (hosting/maintenance)
- Total value created: $27,350 - $52,900 (development + ongoing savings)
